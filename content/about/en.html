`TheSLinux` is born from the idea of some members of ArchLinuxVn
_(the community of Vietnamese ArchLinux Users)_. This new Linux distribution
will focus on Vietnamese users, and it is not a `just-for-fun` project.
We are serious, and we have a plan to develop the project until 2013.

The first generation of `TheSLinux` is based on [ArchLinux][], and it is
just a custom installation of ArchLinux. This is to experience some ideas.
We will have the second generation, and the third one, bla bla ;
please see more details at [our list of generations][versions].
